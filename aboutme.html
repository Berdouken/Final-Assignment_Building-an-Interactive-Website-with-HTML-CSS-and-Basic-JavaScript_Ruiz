      <p>Hi my name is Ralf. I'm an Independant Photographer who expressed it with feelings but being passionate for Photography and I do work hard for it from time to time. I know myself as an Independant Photographer is that I had some fun times editing on the computer and taking some photos on my camera which is great, but it does use my imagination a lot of times so I think that I'm an good photographer and I do great wide shots and portraits shots for fun and I have good memories doing Photography Work and I've totally learned a lot about Photography.</p>
